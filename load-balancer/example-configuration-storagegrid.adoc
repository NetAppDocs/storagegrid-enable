Explore few use cases for StorageGRID configurations implemented by customers and NetApp IT.

The following examples illustrate configurations as implemented by StorageGRID customers, including NetApp IT

== F5 BIG-IP local traffic manager health check monitor for S3 bucket

To configure the F5 BIG-IP local traffic manager health check monitor, follow these steps:

.Steps

. Create a new monitor.
.. In the Type field, enter `HTTPS`.
.. Configure the interval and timeout as desired.
.. In the Send String field, enter `OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n.`
\r\n are carriage returns; different versions of BIG-IP software require zero, one, or two sets of \r\n sequences. For more information, see https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K10655.
.. In the Receive String field, enter: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`.

+

. In Create Pool, create one pool for each port required.
.. Assign the health monitor that you created in the previous step.
.. Select a load-balancing method.
.. Select service port: 18082 (S3).
.. Add nodes.

== Citrix NetScaler
Citrix NetScaler creates a virtual server for the storage endpoint and refers to StorageGRID Storage Nodes as Application Servers, which are then grouped into Services.

Use the HTTPS-ECV health check monitor to create a custom monitor to perform the recommended health check by using the OPTIONS request and receiving `200`. HTTP-ECV is configured with a send string and validates a receive string.

For more information, see the Citrix documentation, https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/load-balancing/load-balancing-builtin-monitors/monitor-ssl-services.html#sample-configuration-for-https-ecv-health-check-monitor[Sample configuration for HTTP-ECV health check monitor^].

== Loadbalancer.org
Loadbalancer.org has conducted their own integration testing with StorageGRID and has an extensive configuration guide: https://pdfs.loadbalancer.org/NetApp_StorageGRID_Deployment_Guide.pdf.

== HAProxy
Configure HAProxy to use the OPTIONS request and check for a 200 status response for the health check in haproxy.cfg. You can change the bind port in the front end to a different port, such as 443.

The following is an example for SSL termination on HAProxy:

----
frontend s3
       bind *:443 crt /etc/ssl/server.pem ssl
       default_backend s3-serve
rs
backend s3-servers
       balance leastconn
       option httpchk
       http-check expect status 200
       server dc1-s1 10.63.174.71:18082 ssl verify none check inter 3000
       server dc1-s2 10.63.174.72:18082 ssl verify none check inter 3000
       server dc1-s3 10.63.174.73:18082 ssl verify none check inter 3000
----

The following is an example for SSL pass-through:

----
frontend s3
       mode tcp 
       bind *:443
       default_backend s3-servers
backend s3-servers
       balance leastconn
       option httpchk
       http-check expect status 200
       server dc1-s1 10.63.174.71:18082 check-ssl verify none inter 3000
       server dc1-s2 10.63.174.72:18082 check-ssl verify none inter 3000
       server dc1-s3 10.63.174.73:18082 check-ssl verify none inter 3000
