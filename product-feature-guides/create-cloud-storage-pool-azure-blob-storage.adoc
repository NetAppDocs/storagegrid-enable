[.lead]
You can use a Cloud Storage Pool if you want to move StorageGRID objects to an external Azure container.

.What you'll need
* StorageGRID 11.6 has been configured.
* You have already set up an external Azure container.

.Steps

. In the Grid Manager, navigate to *ILM* > *Storage Pools*.

. In the Cloud Storage Pools section of the page, select *Create*.
+
The Create Cloud Storage Pool pop-up appears.

. Enter a display name.

. Select *Azure Blob Storage* from the Provider Type drop-down list.

. Enter the URI for the S3 bucket to be used for the Cloud Storage Pool.
+
Two formats are allowed:
+
`https://host:port`
+
`http://host:port`

. Enter the Azure container name.
+
The name you specify must exactly match the Azure container name; otherwise, Cloud Storage Pool creation fails. You cannot change this value after the Cloud Storage Pool is saved.

. Optionally, enter the Azure containerâ€™s associated account name and account key for authentication.

. Select *Do Not Verify Certificate* from the drop-down.

. Click *Save*.

.Expected result
Confirm that a Cloud Storage Pool has been created for Azure Blob Storage.
