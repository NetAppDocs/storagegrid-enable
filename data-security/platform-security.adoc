|Feature
|Function
|Impact
|Regulatory compliance

|Internal public-key infrastructure (PKI), node certificates, and TLS
|StorageGRID uses an internal PKI and node certificates to authenticate and encrypt internode communication. Internode communication is secured by TLS.
|Helps secure system traffic over the LAN or WAN, especially in a multisite deployment.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)

|Node firewall
|StorageGRID automatically configures IP tables and firewalling rules to control incoming and outgoing network traffic, as well as closing unused ports.
|Helps protect the StorageGRID system, data, and metadata against unsolicited network traffic.
|--

|OS hardening
|The base operating system of StorageGRID physical appliances and virtual nodes is hardened; unrelated software packages are removed.
|Helps minimize potential attack surfaces.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)

|Periodic platform and software updates
|StorageGRID provides regular software releases that include operating system, applications binaries, and software updates.
|Helps keep the StorageGRID system updated with current software and application binaries.
|--

|Disabled Root Login Over Secure Shell (SSH)
|Root login over SSH is disabled on all StorageGRID nodes. SSH access uses certificate authentication.
|Helps customers protect against potential remote password cracking of the root login.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)

|Automated time synchronization
|StorageGRID automatically synchronizes system clocks of each node against multiple external time Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. At least four NTP servers of Stratum 3 or later are required.
|Ensures the same time reference across all nodes.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)

|Separate networks for client, admin, and internal grid traffic
|StorageGRID software nodes and hardware appliances support multiple virtual and physical network interfaces, so that customers can separate client, administration, and internal grid traffic over different networks.
|Allow Grid administrators to segregate internal and external network traffic and deliver traffic over networks with different SLAs.
|--

|Multiple virtual LAN (VLAN) interfaces
|StorageGRID supports configuring VLAN interfaces on your StorageGRID client and grid networks.
|Allow Grid administrators to partition and isolate application traffic for security, flexibility, and performance.
|

|Untrusted Client Network
|The Untrusted Client Network interface accepts inbound connections only on ports that have been explicitly configured as load-balancer endpoints.
|Ensures that interfaces exposed to untrusted networks are secured.
|--

|Configurable Firewall
|Manage open and closed ports for Admin,Grid, and client networks.
|Allow grid administrators to control access on ports and manage approved device access to the ports.
|

|Enhanced SSH behavior
|New SSH host certificates and host keys are generated when upgrading a node to StorageGRID 11.5.
|Enhances man-in-the-middle attack protection.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)

|Node encryption
|As part of the new KMS host server encryption feature, a new Node Encryption setting is added to the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
|This setting must be enabled during the hardware configuration stage of appliance installation.
|SEC Rule 17a-4(f)
CTFC 1.31(c)-(d)
(FINRA) Rule 4511(c)
