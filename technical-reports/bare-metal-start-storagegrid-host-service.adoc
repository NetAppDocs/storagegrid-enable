Learn how to start the StorageGRID host service.

To start the StorageGRID nodes and ensure that they restart after a host reboot, you must enable and start the StorageGRID host service.

To start the StorageGRID host service, complete the following steps.

.Steps
. Run the following commands on each host:
+
----
sudo systemctl enable storagegrid
sudo systemctl start storagegrid
----
+
NOTE: The start process might take some time on the initial run.

. Run the following command to ensure the deployment is proceeding:
+
----
sudo storagegrid node status node-name
----
+
. For any node that returns a status of `Not-Running` or `Stopped`, run the following command:
+
----
sudo storagegrid node start node-name
----
For example, given the following output you would start the `dc1-adm1` node:
+
----
[user@host1]# sudo storagegrid node status
Name Config-State Run-State
dc1-adm1 Configured Not-Running
dc1-sn1 Configured Running
----
+
. If you have previously enabled and started the StorageGRID host service (or if you arenâ€™t sure whether the service has been enabled and started), also run the following command:
+
----
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart storagegrid
----
