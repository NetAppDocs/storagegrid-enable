Understand the importance and the steps to implement of SSL certificates in StorageGRID.

If you are using HTTPs, you must have a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The SSL protocol identifies the clients and endpoints, validating them as trusted. SSL also provides encryption of the traffic. The SSL certificate must be trusted by the clients. To accomplish this, the SSL certificate can be from a globally trusted Certificate Authority (CA) such as DigiCert, a private CA running in your infrastructure, or a self-signed certificate generated by the host. 

Using a globally trusted CA certificate is the preferred method as there is no additional client-side actions required. The certificate is loaded into the load balancer or StorageGRID, and the clients trust and connect to the endpoint.

Using a private CA requires the root and all subordinate certificates be added to the client. The process to trust a private CA certificate can vary by client operating system and applications. For example, in ONTAP for FabricPool, you must upload each certificate in the chain individually (root certificate, subordinate certificate, endpoint certificate) to the ONTAP cluster.

Using a self-signed certificate requires the client to trust the provided certificate without any CA to verify the authenticity. Some applications might not accept self-signed certificates and have no ability to ignore verification.

The placement of the SSL certificate in the client load balancer StorageGRID path depends on where you need the SSL termination to be. You can configure a load balancer to be the termination endpoint for the client, and then re-encrypt or hot encrypt with a new SSL certificate for the load balancer to StorageGRID connection. Or you can pass through the traffic and let StorageGRID be the SSL termination endpoint. If the load balancer is the SSL termination endpoint, the certificate is installed on the load balancer and contains the subject name for the DNS name/URL and any alternative URL/DNS names for which a client is configured to connect to the StorageGRID target through the load balancer, including any wild card names. If the load balancer is configured for pass through, the SSL certificate must be installed in StorageGRID. Again, the certificate must contain the subject name for the DNS name/URL, and any alternative URL/DNS names for which a client is configured to connect to the StorageGRID target through the load balancer, including any wild card names. Individual Storage Node names do not need to be included on the certificate, only the endpoint URLs.
