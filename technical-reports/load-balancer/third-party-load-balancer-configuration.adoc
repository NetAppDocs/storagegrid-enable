Learn how to configure trusted third-party load balancer in StorageGRID.

If you are using one or more external layer 7 load balancers, and an S3 bucket or group policies that are IP based, StorageGRID must determine the real senderâ€™s IP address. It does this by looking at the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, which is inserted into the request by the load balancer. As the XFF header can be easily spoofed in requests sent directly to the Storage Nodes, StorageGRID must confirm that each request is being routed by a trusted layer 7 load balancer. If StorageGRID cannot trust the source of the request, it will ignore the XFF header. There is a Grid Management API to allow a list of trusted external layer 7 load balancers to be configured. This new API is private and is subject to change in future StorageGRID releases.
