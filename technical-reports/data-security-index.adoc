Discover the integral security features of the StorageGRID object storage solution.

This is an overview of the many security features in NetApp® StorageGRID®, covering data access, objects and metadata, administrative access, and platform security. It has been updated to include the newest features released with StorageGRID 11.9.

Security is an integral part of the NetApp StorageGRID object storage solution. Security is particularly important because many types of rich content data that are well suited for object storage are also sensitive in nature and subject to regulations and compliance. As StorageGRID capabilities continue to evolve, the software makes available many security features that are invaluable for protecting an organization’s security posture and helping the organization adhere to industry best practices.

This paper is an overview of the many security features in StorageGRID 11.9, divided into five categories:

* Data access security features
* Object and metadata security features
* Administration security features
* Platform security features
* Cloud integration

This paper is intended to be a security datasheet—it does not detail how to configure the system to support the security features enumerated within that are not configured by default. The https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/harden/index.html[StorageGRID Hardening Guide^] is available on the official https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/[StorageGRID Documentation^] page.
