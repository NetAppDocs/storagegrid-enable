Learn how to validate the content of the configuration files for StorageGRID.

After you create the configuration files in `/etc/storagegrid/nodes` for each of your StorageGRID nodes, you must validate the contents of those files.

To validate the contents of the configuration files, run the following command on each host:
----
sudo storagegrid node validate all
----

If the files are correct, the output shows PASSED for each configuration file:

If the configuration files are incorrect, the issues are shown as WARNING and ERROR. If any configuration errors are found, you must correct them before you continue with the installation.
