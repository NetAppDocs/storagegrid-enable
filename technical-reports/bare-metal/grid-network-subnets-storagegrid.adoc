Learn how to configure the grid network subnets for StorageGRID.

You must specify the subnets that are used on the grid network.

The subnet entries include the subnets for the grid network for each site in your StorageGRID system, in addition to any subnets that must be reachable through the grid network (for example, the subnets hosting your NTP servers).

If you have multiple grid subnets, the grid network gateway is required. All grid subnets specified must be reachable through this gateway.

To specify grid network subnets, complete the following steps:

.Steps
. In the Subnet 1 text box, specify the CIDR network address for at least one grid network.
. Click the plus sign next to the last entry to add an additional network entry.
If you have already deployed at least one node, click Discover Grid Networks Subnets to automatically populate the grid network subnet list with the subnets reported by grid nodes that have registered with Grid Manager.
