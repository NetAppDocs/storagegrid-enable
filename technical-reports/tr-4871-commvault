== Solution Overview

Commvault and NetApp have partnered to create a joint data protection solution combining Commvault Complete Backup and Recovery for NetApp software with NetApp StorageGRID software for cloud storage. Many organizations want to migrate their storage to the cloud, scale their systems, and automate their policy for long-term retention of data. Commvault Complete Backup and Recovery and NetApp StorageGRID provide unique, easy-to-use solutions that work together to help you meet demands of rapid data growth and increasing regulations around the world. Cloud-based object storage is known for its resilience, ability to scale, and operational and cost efficiencies that make it a natural choice as a target for your backup. Commvault and NetApp jointly certified their combined solution in 2014 and since then have engineered deeper integration between their two solutions. Customers of all types around the world have adopted the Commvault Complete Backup and Recovery and StorageGRID combined solution.

When you implement Commvault Complete Backup and Recovery software with cloud storage, you have two backup options:

* Back up to a primary disk target and also back up an auxiliary copy to cloud storage.
* Back up to cloud storage as the primary target.

In the past, cloud or object storage was considered to be too low-performing to be used for primary backup. The use of a primary disk target allowed customers to have faster backup and restore processes and to keep an auxiliary copy on the cloud as a cold backup. StorageGRID represents the next generation of object storage. StorageGRID is capable of high performance and massive throughput as well as performance and flexibility beyond what other object-storage vendors offer.

Table 1 lists the benefits of each backup option with StorageGRID.

NetApp StorageGRID as a Commvault cloud tier is an enterprise hybrid-cloud object-storage solution. You can deploy it across many sites, either on a purpose-built appliance or as a software-defined deployment. StorageGRID enables you to establish data management policies that determine how data is stored and protected. StorageGRID collects the information you need to develop and enforce policies. It examines a wide range of characteristics and needs, including performance, durability, availability, geographic location, longevity, and cost. Data is fully maintained and protected as it moves between locations and as it ages.

The StorageGRID intelligent policy engine helps you choose either of the following options:

* To use erasure coding to back up data across multiple sites for resilience.
* To copy objects to remote sites to minimize WAN latency and cost.

When StorageGRID stores an object, you access it as one object, regardless of where it is or how many copies exist. This behavior is crucial for disaster recovery, because with it, even if one backup copy of your data is corrupted, StorageGRID is able to restore your data.

Retaining backup data in your primary storage can be expensive. When you use NetApp StorageGRID, you free up space on your primary storage by migrating inactive backup data into StorageGRID while you benefit from the numerous capabilities of StorageGRID. The value of backup data changes over time, as does the cost of storing it. StorageGRID can minimize the cost of your primary storage while increasing the durability of your data.

=== Solution Setup 

In the lab setup, the StorageGRID environment consisted of four NetApp StorageGRID SG5712 appliances, one virtual primary Admin node and one virtual Gateway node. The SG5712 appliance is the entry level option—a baseline configuration. Choosing higher performance appliance options such as the NetApp StorageGRID SG5760 or SG6060 can provide significant performance benefits. Consult your NetApp StorageGRID solution architect for sizing assistance.

For its data protection policy, StorageGRID uses an integrated lifecycle management (ILM) policy to manage and protect data. ILM rules are evaluated in a policy from top to bottom. We implemented the ILM policy shown in Table 2.

[#_Toc56174152 .anchor]####Table 2) StorageGRID ILM policy.

[cols="1a,1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|ILM Rule |Qualifiers |Ingest Behavior
|Erasure Coding 2+1 |Objects over 200KB |Balanced
|2 Copy |All objects |Dual Commit
|===

The ILM 2 Copy rule is the default rule. The Erasure Coding 2+1 rule was applied for this testing to any object 200KB or larger. The default rule was applied to objects smaller than 200KB. Application of the rules in this way is a StorageGRID best practice.

For technical details about this test environment, read the Solution Design and Best Practices section in the https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4831.pdf[NetApp Scale-out Data Protection with Commvault] technical report.

== StorageGRID Sizing Guidance

Before you perform NetApp StorageGRID sizing, consider these aspects of your workload:

* Usable capacity
* WORM mode
* Average object size
* Performance requirements
* ILM policy applied

The amount of usable capacity needs to accommodate the size of the backup workload you have tiered to StorageGRID and the retention schedule.

Will WORM mode be enabled or not? With WORM enabled in Commvault, this will configure object lock on StorageGRID. This will increase the object storage capacity required. The amount of capacity required will vary based on the retention duration and number of object changes with each backup.

Average object size is an input parameter that helps with sizing for performance in a StorageGRID environment. The average object sizes used for a Commvault workload depend on the type of backup.

Table 3 lists average object sizes by type of backup and describes what the restore process reads from the object store.

==== Table 3) Commvault workload object size and restore behavior.

[cols="1a,1a,1a",options="header",]
|===
|Backup Type |Average Object Size |Restore Behavior
|Make an auxiliary copy in StorageGRID |32MB |Full read of 32MB object
|Direct the backup to StorageGRID (deduplication enabled) |8MB |1MB random-range read
|Direct the backup to StorageGRID (deduplication disabled) |32MB |Full read of 32MB object
|===

In addition, understanding your performance requirements for full backups and incremental backups helps you determine sizing for the StorageGRID storage nodes. StorageGRID information lifecycle management (ILM) policy data protection methods determine the capacity needed to store Commvault backups and affect the sizing of the grid.

StorageGRID ILM replication is one of two mechanisms used by StorageGRID to store object data. When StorageGRID assigns objects to an ILM rule that replicates data, the system creates exact copies of the objects’ data and stores the copies on storage nodes.

Erasure coding is the second method used by StorageGRID to store object data. When StorageGRID assigns objects to an ILM rule that is configured to create erasure-coded copies, it slices object data into data fragments. It then computes additional parity fragments and stores each fragment on a different storage node. When an object is accessed, it is reassembled using the stored fragments. If a data fragment or a parity fragment becomes corrupt or is lost, the erasure-coding algorithm can re-create that fragment using a subset of the remaining data and parity fragments.

The two mechanisms require different amounts of storage, as these examples demonstrate:

* If you store two replicated copies, your storage overhead doubles.
* If you store a 2+1 erasure-coded copy, your storage overhead increases by 1.5 times.

For the solution tested, StorageGRID is used as secondary storage. In this solution, a baseline system represents an entry-level StorageGRID deployment on a single site:

* Admin node: VMware virtual machine (VM)
* Load balancer: VMware VM
* Storage nodes: 4x SG5712 with 4TB drives
* Primary Admin node and Gateway node: VMware VMs with the minimum production workload requirements

StorageGRID is typically deployed in two or more sites with data protection policies that replicate data to protect against node and site-level failures. By backing up your data to StorageGRID, your data is protected by multiple copies or by erasure coding that separates and reassembles data dependably through an algorithm.

You can use the https://fieldportal.netapp.com/content/593648[StorageGRID Solution Designer tool] to size your grid.

== StorageGRID Hardware Specifications 

Table 4 describes the NetApp StorageGRID hardware used in this testing. The StorageGRID SG5712 appliance with 10Gbps networking is the entry-level option and represents a baseline configuration. Optionally the SG5712 can be configured for 25Gbps networking.

Choosing higher-performance appliance options such as the NetApp StorageGRID SG5760, SG6060, or all flash SGF6112 appliances can provide significant performance benefits. Consult your NetApp StorageGRID solution architect for sizing assistance.

== Bucket Consistency Level Recommendation

NetApp StorageGRID allows the end user to select the consistency level for operations performed on the objects in Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets.

Commvault MediaAgents are the data movers in a Commvault environment. In most cases, MediaAgents are configured to write locally into a primary StorageGRID site. For this reason, a high consistency level within a local primary site is recommended. Use the following guidelines when you set the consistency level on Commvault buckets created in StorageGRID.

. If you have a Commvault version earlier than 11.0.0 - Service Pack 16, consider upgrading Commvault to the newest version. If that is not an option, be sure to follow the guidelines for your version.

* *Commvault versions earlier than 11.0.0 - Service Pack 16.* In versions earlier than 11.0.0 - Service Pack 16, Commvault performs S3 HEAD and GET operations on non-existent objects as part of restore and pruning process. Set the bucket consistency level to Strong-site to achieve the optimal consistency level for Commvault backups to StorageGRID.
* *Commvault versions 11.0.0 - Service Pack 16 and later.* In versions 11.0.0 - Service Pack 16 and later, the number of S3 HEAD and GET operations performed on non-existent objects are minimized. Set the default bucket consistency level to Read-after-new-write to ensure high consistency level in the Commvault and StorageGRID environment.
