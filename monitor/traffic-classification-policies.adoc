Learn how to set up and monitor Traffic Classification Policies in StorageGRID 11.4 for efficient traffic management and network bandwidth optimization.

Traffic Classification Policies are new to StorageGRID 11.4 and provide a method to monitor and/or limit traffic based on a specific tenant, buckets, IP subnets, or load balancer endpoints. Network connectivity and bandwidth are especially important metrics for StorageGRID.

To configure a Traffic Classification Policy, follow these steps:

. On the GMI, navigate to menu:Configuration[System Settings > Traffic Classification].
