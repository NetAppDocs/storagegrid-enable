Discover how to use the StorageGRID audit log for detailed insights into tenant and grid activity, and how to leverage tools like Splunk for log analysis.

The StorageGRID audit log enables you to collect detailed information about tenant and grid activity. The audit log can be exposed for analytics through NFS. For detailed instructions on how to export the audit log, see the Administratorâ€™s Guide.

After the audit has been exported, you can use log analysis tools such as Splunk or Logstash + Elasticsearch to understand tenant activity or to create detailed billing and chargeback reports.

Details about audit messages are included in StorageGRID documentation. See https://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=61023[Audit messages].
