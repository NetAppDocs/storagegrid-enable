Learn how to use the alerts system in StorageGRID to monitor issues, manage custom alerts, and extend alert notifications using SNMP or email.

Alerts provide critical information that allow you to monitor the various events and conditions within your StorageGRID system.

With StorageGRID 11.4, the alerts system is designed to be the primary tool for monitoring any issues that might occur in your StorageGRID system. The alerts system focuses on actionable problems in the system and provides an easy-to-use interface. Although the alarms system continues to be supported in StorageGRID 11.4, it is considered a legacy system.

We provide a variety of default alerting rules that aim to help monitor and troubleshoot your system. You can further manage alerts by creating custom alerts, editing or disabling default alerts, and silencing alert notifications.

Alerts are also extensible through SNMP or email notification.
