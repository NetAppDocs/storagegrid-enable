Discover how to use Grafana for metric visualization in NetApp StorageGRID, including accessing preconstructed dashboards for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Grafana is an open-source software for metric visualization. By default, we have preconstructed dashboards that provide useful and powerful information regarding your StorageGRID system.

These preconstructed dashboards are not only useful for monitoring but also for troubleshooting an issue. Some are intended for use by technical support. For example, to view the metrics of a storage node, follow these steps.

. From the GMI, Support → Metrics.
. Under the Grafana section, select the Node dashboard.
