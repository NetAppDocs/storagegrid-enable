. Add primary storage, which is used to store the data temporarily before it is moved to object storage. 
If you need help in setting up a direct storage repository, see the https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/repository_launch.html?ver=95u4[Veeam Backup Repository Setup Guide^].

Veeam allows you to move the oldest backup files sooner if the backup repository is reaching capacity.

NOTE: After the backup chains are created and stored on the performance tier (SOBR’s standard, non-object extents), they become a subject for tiering conditions, based on the configured policy of the capacity tier.
