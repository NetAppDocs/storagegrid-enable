Understand the hardware specifications of StorageGRID used in qualification.

The following table describes the NetApp StorageGRID hardware used in this testing. The StorageGRID SG5712 
appliance with 10Gbps networking is the entry-level option and represents a baseline configuration. 
Optionally the SG5712 can be configured for 25Gbps networking. 

Choosing higher-performance appliance options such as the NetApp StorageGRID SG5760 or SG6060 
appliance can provide significant performance benefits. Consult your NetApp StorageGRID solution 
architect for sizing assistance.
