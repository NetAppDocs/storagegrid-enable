Learn about the crucial aspects of workloads for effective StorageGRID sizing.

Before you perform NetApp StorageGRID sizing, consider these aspects of your workload: 

* Usable capacity 
* Average object size 
* Performance requirements 
* ILM policy applied

The amount of usable capacity needs to accommodate the size of the backup workload you have tiered to StorageGRID. 

Average object size is an input parameter that helps with sizing for performance in a StorageGRID environment. The average object sizes used for a Commvault workload depend on the type of backup.

The following table lists average object sizes by type of backup and describes what the restore process reads from the object store.

[cols=4*,options="header",cols="60,25,40"]
|===
| Backup Type
| Average Object Size
| Restore Behavior
| Make an auxiliary copy in StorageGRID  | 32MB | Full read of 32MB object
| Direct the backup to StorageGRID (deduplication enabled) | 8MB | 1MB random-range read
| Direct the backup to StorageGRID (deduplication disabled) | 32MB | Full read of 32MB object
|===

In addition, understanding your performance requirements for full backups and incremental backups helps you determine sizing for the StorageGRID storage nodes. StorageGRID information lifecycle management (ILM) policy data protection methods determine the capacity needed to store Commvault backups and affect the sizing of the grid.

StorageGRID ILM replication is one of two mechanisms used by StorageGRID to store object data. When StorageGRID assigns objects to an ILM rule that replicates data, the system creates exact copies of the objectsâ€™ data and stores the copies on storage nodes.

Erasure coding is the second method used by StorageGRID to store object data. When StorageGRID assigns objects to an ILM rule that is configured to create erasure-coded copies, it slices object data into data fragments. It then computes additional parity fragments and stores each fragment on a different storage node. When an object is accessed, it is reassembled using the stored fragments. If a data fragment or a parity fragment becomes corrupt or is lost, the erasure-coding algorithm can re-create that fragment using a subset of the remaining data and parity fragments. 

The two mechanisms require different amounts of storage, as these examples demonstrate:

* If you store two replicated copies, your storage overhead doubles.

* If you store a 2+1 erasure-coded copy, your storage overhead increases by 1.5 times.

For the solution tested, StorageGRID is used as secondary storage. In this solution, a baseline system 
represents an entry-level StorageGRID deployment on a single site:

* Admin node: VMware virtual machine (VM)

* Load balancer: VMware VM 

*  Storage nodes: 4x SG5712 with 4TB drives 

* Primary Admin node and Gateway node: VMware VMs with the minimum production workload requirements 

StorageGRID is typically deployed in two or more sites with data protection policies that replicate data to protect against node and site-level failures. By backing up your data to StorageGRID, your data is protected by multiple copies or by erasure coding that separates and reassembles data dependably through an algorithm.
