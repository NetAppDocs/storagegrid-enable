Understand the results from the baseline performance tests for Commvault and StorageGRID.

The following table shows the results from our baseline performance tests. In the Aux Copy operation, our Commvault MediaAgents backed up data to a NetApp AFF A300 system and an auxiliary copy was created on NetApp StorageGRID. For details on the test setup environment, read the Solution Design and Best Practices section in the https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4831.pdf[NetApp Scale-out Data Protection with Commvault^] technical report.

The tests were performed with 100 VMs and 1000 VMs, both tests with a 50/50 mix of Windows and CentOS VMs.

| Operation
| Backup Speed
| Restore Speed
| Aux Copy | 2 TB/hour | 1.27 TB/hour
| Direct to and from object (Deduplication On)| 2.2 TB/hour | 1.22 TB/hour

To test age-off performance, 2.5 million objects were deleted. As shown in the following figures, delete run was completed in less than 3 hours and freed up more than 80TB of space. The delete run started at 10:30 AM.
