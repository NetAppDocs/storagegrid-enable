Understand the software requirements for Commvault and StorageGRID installed on VMware.

The following tables list the software requirements for the Commvault and NetApp StorageGRID software installed on VMware software for this test. Four MediaAgent data transmission managers and one CommServe server were installed on NetApp HCI compute nodes. In the test, 10Gbps networking was implemented for the VMware infrastructure.
